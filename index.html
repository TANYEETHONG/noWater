        <h2>About My Home Town</h2>
        <p>
            Kedah is my hometown and it is a peaceful place to live.
Many people in Kedah work in farming, especially growing rice, which is why the state is called the Rice Bowl of Malaysia.
I like Kedah because it has beautiful scenery and famous places such as Langkawi that attract many visitors.
